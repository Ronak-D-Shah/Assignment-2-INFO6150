        <h1>About Ronak Shah</h1>
        <p><em>Passionate Software Engineer and Web Developer</em></p>

        <p>
          Hello! I'm Ronak Shah, a dedicated software engineer and web developer
          based in Boston, Massachusetts. I have a relentless enthusiasm for
          crafting innovative solutions and designing user-friendly interfaces.
          With a solid foundation in both software engineering and web
          development, I am on a continuous journey to create meaningful digital
          experiences.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Software Engineering
          with a Systems specialization at Northeastern University, with an
          expected graduation date in May 2025. I hold a Bachelor's degree in
          Information Technology from Manipal University Jaipur, India, where I
          graduated in May 2023 with a commendable cumulative GPA of 8.31/10. My
          educational journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of both
          theory and practical application in the field.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          My technical toolkit includes a range of programming languages such as
          C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I am proficient in various
          frameworks and libraries, including React.js, Express.js, Node.js, and
          jQuery. Databases like MySQL and MongoDB are where I store and manage
          data effectively. My familiarity with tools and operating systems like
          Git, Windows, Linux, and Visual Studio Code empowers me to work
          efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I have gained valuable industry experience through internships and
          roles at prominent organizations. As a Software Engineering Intern at
          Unicorn Flexo Graphics in Mumbai, India, I contributed to the
          development of an inventory management website, showcasing my skills
          in React, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB. I also interned at Shri
          Shantinath Co, where I optimized backend infrastructure to boost sales
          performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to my internships, I worked as a Web Developer at Edusha
          University, focusing on creating responsive and user-friendly web
          pages while integrating third-party APIs to enhance functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          One of my notable projects involved developing a machine
          learning-based model for brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. I
          utilized deep learning techniques and frameworks like TensorFlow and
          Keras to achieve accurate tumor localization and segmentation. This
          project exemplifies my commitment to leveraging technology for
          healthcare advancements.
        </p>

        <h2>Publications</h2>
        <p>
          I am proud to have co-authored a publication titled "Cardiovascular
          Disease Detection using Power Transformation and Gradient-Boosting
          Classifier," which was presented at ICACITE and published by IEEE.
          This showcases my dedication to academic and research-oriented
          pursuits.
        </p>
