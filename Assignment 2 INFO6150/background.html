        <h1>Background</h1>

        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio! I'm thrilled to share my journey,
          experiences, and creative endeavors with you. This page offers a
          glimpse into my background, helping you get to know me better.
        </p>

        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>

        <p>
          I am Ronak Shah, a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer with a
          love for problem solving and taking on new challenges. My journey in
          the world of programming began 5 years ago when I discovered my
          deep-seated passion for solfware applications. Since then, I've been
          on a remarkable journey of growth, learning, and creativity.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>
          My quest for knowledge led me to pursue formal education in Software
          Enginnering. I am earning my Mater's degree from Northeastern
          University and honed my skills in Web Development and Software
          Development. My time in academia equipped me with a strong foundation
          and a thirst for continuous learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

        <p>
          I have had the privilege of working with some incredible organizations
          over the years. My professional journey has taken me through various
          roles and responsibilities, each contributing to my growth and
          expertise.
        </p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>

        <p>
          I believe in the power of constant practice and bettering myself in
          various forms for the industry, and I strive to incorporate these
          principles into everything I do. I approach each project with
          understanding the depth of the problem, ensuring that the end result
          is not just a product but a work of art that meets and exceeds
          expectations.
        </p>

        <h2>Creative Passions</h2>

        <p>
          Beyond my professional life, I am deeply passionate about animals and
          music. These interests serve as a wellspring of inspiration for my
          work and provide me with a unique perspective in my field. When I'm
          not working, you can often find me helping stray dogs or working for
          NGOs.
